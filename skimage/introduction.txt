In our data-rich world, images represent a significant subset of all
measurements made. Examples include DNA microarrays, microscopy slides,
astronomical observations, satellite maps, robotic vision capture, synthetic
aperture radar images, and higher-dimensional images such as 3-D magnetic
resonance or computed tomography imaging. To explore these rich data sources
requires sophisticated software tools that should be easy to use, free of
charge and restrictions, and able to address all the challenges posed by such a
diverse field of analysis.

This paper describes scikit-image, a collection of image processing algorithms
implemented in the Python programming language by an active community of
volunteers and available under the liberal BSD Open Source license.
The rising popularity of Python as a scientific programming language,
together with the increasing availability of a large eco-system of
complementary tools, make it an ideal environment in which to produce
an image processing toolkit.

The project aims are:

1. To provide high quality, well-documented and easy-to-use
   implementations of common image processing algorithms.

   Such algorithms are essential building blocks in many areas of scientific
   research, algorithmic comparisons and data exploration. In the
   context of reproducible science, it is important to be able to inspect any
   source code used for algorithmic flaws or mistakes. Additionally, scientific
   research often requires custom modification of standard algorithms, further
   emphasizing the importance of open source.

2. To facilitate education in image processing.

   The library allows students in image processing to learn algorithms in a
   hands-on fashion by adjusting parameters and modifying code. In addition, a
   ``novice`` module is provided, not only for teaching programming in the
   "turtle graphics" paradigm, but also to familiarize users with image
   concepts such as color and dimensionality. Furthermore, the project
   takes part in the yearly Google Summer of Code [gsoc]_ program, where
   students learn about image processing and software engineering through
   contributing to the project.

3. To address industry challenges.

   High quality reference implementations of trusted algorithms provide
   industry with a reliable way of attacking problems, without having to expend
   significant energy in re-implementing algorithms already available in
   commercial packages.  Companies may use the library entirely free of charge,
   and have the option of contributing changes back, should they so wish.


Getting started
===============

One of the main goals of scikit-image is to make it easy for any user to get
started quickly—especially users already familiar with Python's
scientific tools. To that end, the basic image is just a standard NumPy array,
which exposes pixel data directly to the user. A new user can simply the load
an image from disk (or use one of scikit-image's sample images), process that
image with one or more image filters, and quickly display the results:

.. code-block:: python

   from skimage import data, io, filter

   image = data.coins()  # or any NumPy array!
   edges = filter.sobel(image)
   io.imshow(edges)


.. figure:: getting_started.png

    Illustration of several functions available in scikit-image: adaptive threshold,
    local maxima, edge detection and labels. :label:`gettingstarted`

The above demonstration loads ``data.coins``, an example image shipped with
scikit-image.  For a more complete example, we import NumPy for array
manipulation and matplotlib for plotting.  At each step, we add the picture or
the plot to a matplotlib figure shown in Figure :ref:`gettingstarted`.


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Load a small section of the image.
    image = data.coins()[0:95, 70:370]

    fig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2, nrows=3,
                             figsize=(8, 4))
    ax0, ax1, ax2, ax3, ax4, ax5  = axes.flat
    ax0.imshow(image, cmap=plt.cm.gray)
    ax0.set_title('Original', fontsize=24)
    ax0.axis('off')


Since the image is represented by a Numpy array, we can easily compute
operations like building an histogram of the intensity values.

.. code-block:: python

    # Histogram.
    values, bins = np.histogram(image,
                                bins=np.arange(256))

    ax1.plot(bins[:-1], values, lw=2, c='k')
    ax1.set_xlim(xmax=256)
    ax1.set_yticks([0, 400])
    ax1.set_aspect(.2)
    ax1.set_title('Histogram', fontsize=24)


To divide the foreground and background, we threshold the image to produce
a binary image.  Several threshold algorithms are available. Here, we
employ ``filter.threshold_adaptive`` where the threshold value is the weighted
mean for the local neighborhood of a pixel.

.. code-block:: python

    # Apply threshold.
    from skimage.filter import threshold_adaptive

    bw = threshold_adaptive(image, 95, offset=-15)

    ax2.imshow(bw, cmap=plt.cm.gray)
    ax2.set_title('Adaptive threshold', fontsize=24)
    ax2.axis('off')

We can easily detect interesting features, such as local maxima and edges. The
function ``feature.peak_local_max`` can be used to return the coordinates of
local maxima in an image.

.. code-block:: python

    # Find maxima.
    from skimage.feature import peak_local_max

    coordinates = peak_local_max(image, min_distance=20)

    ax3.imshow(image, cmap=plt.cm.gray)
    ax3.autoscale(False)
    ax3.plot(coordinates[:, 1],
             coordinates[:, 0], 'r.')
    ax3.set_title('Peak local maxima', fontsize=24)
    ax3.axis('off')

Next, a Canny filter (``filter.canny``) [Canny]_ detects the edge of each coin.

.. code-block:: python

    # Detect edges.
    from skimage import filter

    edges = filter.canny(image, sigma=3,
                         low_threshold=10,
                         high_threshold=80)

    ax4.imshow(edges, cmap=plt.cm.gray)
    ax4.set_title('Edges', fontsize=24)
    ax4.axis('off')


Then, we attribute to each coin a label (``morphology.label``) that can be used
to extract a sub-picture. Finally, physical information such as the position,
area, eccentricity, perimeter, and moments can be extracted using
``measure.regionprops``.

.. code-block:: python

    # Label image regions.
    from skimage.measure import regionprops
    import matplotlib.patches as mpatches
    from skimage.morphology import label

    label_image = label(edges)

    ax5.imshow(image, cmap=plt.cm.gray)
    ax5.set_title('Labeled items', fontsize=24)
    ax5.axis('off')

    for region in regionprops(label_image):
        # Draw rectangle around segmented coins.
        minr, minc, maxr, maxc = region.bbox
        rect = mpatches.Rectangle((minc, minr),
                                  maxc - minc,
                                  maxr - minr,
                                  fill=False,
                                  edgecolor='red',
                                  linewidth=2)
        ax5.add_patch(rect)

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()


Content
=======

The scikit-image project started in August of 2009 and has received
contributions from more than 100 individuals [ohloh]_.  The package can be
installed from, amongst other sources, the Python Package Index, Continuum
Anaconda [anaconda]_, Enthought Canopy [canopy]_, Python(x,y) [pythonxy]_,
NeuroDebian [neurodebian]_ and GNU/Linux distributions such as Ubuntu [ubuntu]_.
In March 2014 alone, the package was downloaded more than 5000 times from the
Python Package Index [pypi]_.

The package currently contains the following sub-modules:

- color: Color space conversion.
- data: Test images and example data.
- draw: Drawing primitives (lines, text, etc.) that operate on NumPy arrays.
- exposure:  Image intensity adjustment, e.g., histogram equalization, etc.
- feature: Feature detection and extraction, e.g., texture analysis, corners, etc.
- filter: Sharpening, edge finding, rank filters, thresholding, etc.
- graph: Graph-theoretic operations, e.g., shortest paths.
- io: Reading, saving, and displaying images and video.
- measure: Measurement of image properties, e.g., similarity and contours.
- morphology: Morphological operations, e.g., opening or skeletonization.
- novice: Simplified interface for teaching purposes.
- restoration: Restoration algorithms, e.g., deconvolution algorithms, denoising, etc.
- segmentation: Partitioning an image into multiple regions.
- transform: Geometric and other transforms, e.g., rotation or the Radon transform.
- viewer: A simple graphical user interface for visualizing results and exploring parameters.

Data format
===========

scikit-image uses NumPy arrays [numpy]_ to represent images.  Each array has a
shape, e.g., ``(M, N)`` for grey-level images, ``(M, N, P)`` for multi-channel
images, or ``(M, N, P, Q)`` for temporal and other multi-dimensional data.  In
addition, various data-types, such as ``float`` or ``uint8``, describe the
numerical type of the stored elements. Since NumPy arrays are a standard and
efficient representation for homogeneous data in Python, data can be passed
along as-is to most other tools such as NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib,
scikit-learn [scikit-learn]_, OpenCV, etc.

Pipelining
==========

Images of differing data-types can complicate the construction of pipelines.
scikit-image follows an "Anything In, Anything Out" approach, whereby all
functions are expected to allow input of an arbitrary data-type but, for
efficiency, also get to choose their own output format.  That said, data-type
ranges are clearly defined, e.g., floating point images are expected to have
values between 0 and 1 (unsigned images) or -1 and 1 (signed images).  Utility
functions like ``img_as_float`` provide an easy way of converting between
data-types.
